# go-osp
An implementation of the Open Scanner Protocol for Go lang.

Currently, this is not a full implmentation, there are missing `profiles` and `vtgroups`.
The main functionalities are implemented, namely: creating and delting a scan, retrieving the results scan and retrieving the OpenVas version.

For more information about OSP, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.greenbone.net/API/OSP/osp.html).
